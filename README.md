# Password Generator

## The application in reference to this README is a web application with code that was initially provided. It was not performing the intended function. I had to take this code and modify it so that it would provide a box in the page with a password generator. The user presses this button and is provided with a prompt asking the user to input a password length between 8-28 chracters. Following is a series of prompts asking what the user would like to include in their password.

## To use this application, press the "generate password" button. You will be given a prompt. Enter the length you would like your password to be and select "ok." After this, prompts providing you the option to choose between uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to include in the random password. Once this is complete, a random password will be generated and will populate in the box on the web application.

## To access this application, you can click the link provided(https://conquerershaki.github.io/challenge-week-03/) or gain access to it through github.

## Through my research, I found a lot of useful bits here and there. Some from StackOverflow, W3Schools, and geeksforgeeks as well.
